# API-countries

This is my solution to the [REST Countries API with color theme switcher](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca). 


## Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- JavaScript
- CSS with Sass
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap 5
- Restful API https://restcountries.com/#rest-countries


## First time installation

### Install latest [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Install all packages from `package.json` locally

```shell
npm ci
```

_If youâ€™re having errors with `node-gyp`, try [installing it globally](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)._

## Development

To develop with automatic compilation and browser refreshing run

```shell
npm start
```

And see the result on `http://localhost:3000/`

## Build

To build everything once for production deploy (in `/dist/` folder)

This build uses all generated HTML files for _UnCSS_. If it removes something you need to keep, add and array to `ignore` option in `gulpfile.esm.js`.

```shell
npm run build
```
